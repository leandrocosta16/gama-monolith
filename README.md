# Monolithic version of the e-commerce platform

This is the source code for a test application built for the purpose of my master's dissertation. 
This is one out of 3 different versions of the same application built for research purposes. This one is the monolithic version, the other ones are the 
microservices-based architecture with a message-driven approach ([link](https://github.com/leandrocosta16/gama-microservices)), and microservices-based but with a direct synchronous 
inter-service communication ([link](https://github.com/leandrocosta16/gama-microservices-direct)).

This version of the application was developed with Java and Spring Boot version `2.4.4`.
